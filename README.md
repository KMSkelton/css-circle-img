# css-circle-img

This is a simple SCSS mixin for making square images display as round. It rounds all the corners by 100% and makes a small border around them (0.2em).
It requires passing in of two items, color and style. The original use case for this mixin called for subtly darker borders, so it only darkens the given color by 5%.
The styles are those of standard CSS borders: none; hidden; dotted; dashed; solid; double; groove; ridge; inset; outset.
